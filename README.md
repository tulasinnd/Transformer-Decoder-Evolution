# transformer-decoder-evolution
This repository contains a **decoder-only Transformer** built from scratch.

The purpose of this repository is to document **how I learned and understood the Transformer decoder**.
Each version here may introduce structural changes,add or remove modules, or explore alternative design choices to understand the decoder more deeply.

All implementations are kept **small-scale and transparent**, so that tensor shapes, attention
mechanisms, and data flow can be inspected clearly.

This repository is **not intended for production use**. The focus is on understanding, experimentation,
and gradual improvement rather than engineering completeness.
